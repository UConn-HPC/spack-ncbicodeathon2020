Spack NCBI Codeathon 2020
-------------------------

Welcome to the [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Biological Data Science Codeathon
2020](https://datascience.nih.gov/news/cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-biological-data-science-codeathon)!

What is Spack?
--------------

Many of us have encountered biological software that is hard to compile and
install.  A project out of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, called
[Spack](https://spack.io/), automatically fetches, patches, and compiles
projects with all of their dependencies for high performance computing
environments, and is also useful on personal computers, lab servers, and cloud
infrastructure.

Spack helps researchers become independent in setting up complex software
independently of their system administrators, as well as helps developers make
their work widely available by reusing over 3000 scientific software packages.
Despite the success of container technologies and portable containers like
[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/), reproducibly compiling software
from source is still necessary for bleeding edge research.

How will we use Spack?
----------------------

Codeathon team members working on this project will attend a Spack guided
session to see Spack from a user's perspective, learn about the development
workflow for packaging various projects, and have several types of
opportunities to:

1. log their experiences to build tutorials for biologists new to Spack, or
2. package their own projects, or
3. help out with good first GitHub issues, and,
4. help developers work their way to becoming maintainers for pull requests and
   troubleshooting package installations.

No prior experience with Spack is necessary, though experience with the command
line will be helpful.  Experience using Python will help contributing to
packages.  All experience levels are welcome.

Schedule
--------

All times below use the US/Eastern Time Zone (ET).

### Pre-codeathon setup

Team members should contact the team leader to install Spack on their local
machine, lab server, HPC cluster, or fallback to using the NIH's cloud
environment (GCP or AWS).  A successful installation will have a working shell,
compiler, compatible python version, and be able to compile and install
packages.

Team members are also encouraged to talk about their interests before the
codeathon weekend.

### Day 1: Saturday, November 7

Time | Event
-|-
10:00-10:30 | Codeathon organizer kick-off meeting
10:30-11:00 | Spack guided session
11:30-12:00 | Group discussion of codeathon goals for each team member

### Day 1-2: Codeathon main event

Each team member will have their own Spack related sub-projects and the team
leader will check-in a few times over the 2 days to shepard their progress.

### Day 2: Saturday, November 7

Time | Event
-|-
13:00-14:00 | Group discussion with the team leader to prepare the final presentation
16:00-17:00 | Final presentation

### Post-codeathon submissions

1. Publish tutorials.
2. Publish packages.
3. Work on manuscript for F1000Research hackathons channel or similar journal.
